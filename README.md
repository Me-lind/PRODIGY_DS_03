# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing Dataset

### Introduction

This project builds a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the bank marketing dataset from the UCI machine learning repository.

### Dataset

The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

### Files

- `bank-additional-full.csv`: The dataset file.
- `decision_tree_classifier.ipynb`: Python script to build the decision tree classifier.
- `README.md`: This file.

### Instructions

1. Download the dataset and save it in the project directory.
2. Run the `decision_tree_classifier.ipynb` script to build and evaluate the model.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Steps to Run the Script

1. Install the required packages:
    
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    
2. Run the script:
    
    python decision_tree_classifier.ipynb

### Results

The accuracy of the decision tree classifier and other evaluation metrics will be printed in the console.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a decision tree classifier using demographic and behavioral data to predict customer behavior.
